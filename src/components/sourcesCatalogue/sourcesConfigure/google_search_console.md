## Google Search Console

Google Search Console is a popular service for marketing and SEO professionals that helps monitor, maintain, and troubleshoot a website’s presence in Google Search results. By integrating Google Search Console, you will be able to analyze ready-to-use analytics-friendly, website search performance data in your data warehouse, and your BI. Go beyond Google Search Console’s vanilla dashboards and ask any question you want about your website activity data. Drill down to your data from visits, keywords, find out which are your most promising pages, or the pages with the most engagement. Having your Google Search Console data in the same data warehouse as your marketing, Google Analytics, support, or sales will help you get a holistic understanding of your business performance. Drill down to your data from your marketing channels, your revenue, and better understand how your visitors and customers engage with your products and content.
