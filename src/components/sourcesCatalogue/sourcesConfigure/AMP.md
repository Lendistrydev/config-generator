## AMP Analytics Component

With RudderStackâ€™s AMP analytics component, you can track your customer event data from your AMP pages. Once enabled, the event requests hit the RudderStack servers, which then route the events to the specified destination platforms as configured by you.

Now you don't need to implement or test multiple components for different destinations for your event data.
