## Segment

Segment is a Customer Data Platform (CDP) that allows you to collect your customer data, while giving you complete control over how you use it. It is a popular tool that is used by many businesses to collect and send event data to various platforms, such as Zendesk, Optimizely, Google Analytics, and more.

You can now seamlessly set up Segment as a source in RudderStack. All you need to do is add a webhook destination in your Segment dashboard that points to RudderStack. This way, you can send events to RudderStack whenever Segment gets an event.
