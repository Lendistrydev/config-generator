## Ruby

RudderStackâ€™s Ruby library allows you to track event data from your Ruby code. Once enabled, the event requests are received by the RudderStack servers, which then route the events to the specified destination platforms as configured by you.

To get started with installing and using the RudderStack Ruby client, check out our GitHub repository.
