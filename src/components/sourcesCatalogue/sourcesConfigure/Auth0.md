## Auth0

[Auth0](https://auth0.com/) is a popular solution used by many companies to add authentication and authorization services to their applications. It is very flexible, and allows you to connect Auth0 to your application with just a few lines of code.

You can add an Auth0 Authentication API webhook in your Auth0 Extension page that points to RudderStack. This way, you can send events to RudderStack whenever Auth0 generates an authentication log.
