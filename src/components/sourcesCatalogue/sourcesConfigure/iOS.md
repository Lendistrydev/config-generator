## iOS

RudderStackâ€™s iOS SDK allows you to integrate RudderStack with your iOS application, to track and collect event data in near real-time. With this SDK, you can also send the event data to your preferred analytics destination platforms such as Google Analytics, Amplitude, Mixpanel, and more.
