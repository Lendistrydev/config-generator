## Customer.io

[Customer.io](https://customer.io/) is a popular marketing platform for sending targeted emails and push and SMS notifications to improve customer engagement and thereby the overall conversion rate.

By adding a reporting webhook in Customer.io which points to RudderStack, you can now send events to RudderStack whenever Customer.io sends messages to your customers. Events such as messages opened, delivered, or clicked on by the customers are captured and sent to RudderStack.
