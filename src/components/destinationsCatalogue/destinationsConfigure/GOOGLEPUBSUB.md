## Google Cloud Pub/Sub

Google Cloud Pub/Sub is an asynchronous messaging service that allows you to decouple the services that produce events from the services that process events. With Pub/Sub, you get durable message storage as well as a real-time message delivery system. The Google Pub/Sub servers run reliably with a consistent performance in all the Google Cloud regions over the world.
