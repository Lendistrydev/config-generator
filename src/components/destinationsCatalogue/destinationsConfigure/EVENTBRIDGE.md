## Amazon EventBridge

Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus that allows you to connect applications using data from your own apps, integrated SaaS applications, or AWS services. You can collect streams of real time data from a variety of event sources such as Zendesk, PagerDuty and more, and route them to your preferred endpoints such as AWS Lambda.
