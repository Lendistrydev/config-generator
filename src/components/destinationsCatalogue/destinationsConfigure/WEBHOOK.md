## Webhooks
Webhooks allow you to send events generated via the RudderStack SDK to your own backend. It is useful for cases where you want to apply some custom logic on the payload before sending it to the destination platforms of your choice. Once enabled, RudderStack forwards the SDK events to your configured webhook endpoint.
