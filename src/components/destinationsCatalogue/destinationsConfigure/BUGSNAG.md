## Bugsnag

Bugsnag provides error reporting libraries for every major software platform which automatically detect and report errors in your applications, and capture diagnostic data required to help you reproduce and fix each error. It also monitors application stability so you can make data-driven decisions on whether you should be building new features, or fixing bugs.
